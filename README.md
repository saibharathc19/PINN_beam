# Solving of Euler Bernoulli beam equation using Physics Inspired Neural Networks
Program is developed to solve Euler- Bernoulli beam equation using Physics Inspired Neural Networks. In this Program, PINN is used to find the displacement of 1m length cantilever beam when it is uniformly loaded with 1N/m2.

The solutions that are obtained from the PINN are compared with the analytical solution and there is a good match between both the result.
